# Introduction
**Lidar Object Detection** - algorithm for detection object on lidar point cloud. This algorithm based on CenterPoint algorithm and connected with [ROS 1 Noetic]()/[ROS 2 Humble]().

# Getting Started

For a step-by-step walkthrough of the installation process, please refer to our [Installation Guide](https://github.com/BleynChannel/3d_detection/blob/main/INSTALL.md). This guide provides detailed instructions to help you get up and running quickly.
